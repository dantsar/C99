These are a series of .c files along with an example output from
processing them through assignment 3 (declaration parser).  Your
output isn't expected to "diff" against this, because how you represent
types and symbols internally is a matter of personal design.

Some of the constructs used in these examples fall into the "optional"
category.  Feel free to delete or modify them.
